A Java port of the [Kiwi C++](https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi) implementation of the Cassowary constraint solving algorithm

## Background
This project was created by porting [Kiwi](https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi) line for line to Java. The objective is to create a faster Java implementation of the Cassowary constraint solving algorithm.

## History

The initial porting work was done in a weekend in at the end of January 2015 by Alex Birkett without a deep understanding of the Cassowary algorithm. 
At that time, the tests ported from the [java cassowary project](https://github.com/pybee/cassowary-java), did not pass. 
The project was forgotten about until early 2016 when [yonsunCN](https://github.com/yongsunCN) found it and fixed it. 

As of January 2016, the testes ported from [java cassowary project](https://github.com/pybee/cassowary-java) now pass. 

## Contributors

* [Alex Birkett](https://github.com/alexbirkett) Initial port from Kiwi C++
* [yonsunCN](https://github.com/yongsunCN) Fixed initial port

## Example usage

        Solver solver = new Solver();
        Variable x = new Variable("x");
        Variable y = new Variable("y");

        // x = 20
        solver.addConstraint(Symbolics.equals(x, 20));

        // x + 2 == y + 10
        solver.addConstraint(Symbolics.equals(Symbolics.add(x,2), Symbolics.add(y, 10)));

        solver.updateVariables();
        
        System.out.println("x " + x.getValue() + " y " + y.getValue());
        // x == 20
        // y == 12

## Constraint string format

where A,B has dot, left half is identifier, right is attribute

where C is a constant value (number or mapped value)

where D is a constant value (number or mapped value)

A = B [*/] C [-+] D @ priority

A = B

A = C @ priority
